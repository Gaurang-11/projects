This project focused on using SQL to analyze and improve the performance of a food delivery startup. By examining various aspects of the business—such as customer behavior, product popularity, delivery efficiency, and revenue trends—through data from tables like customer_orders, sales_summary, and driver_order, we gained actionable insights that led to better decision-making. We identified loyal customers, optimized inventory based on ingredient usage, improved delivery times by analyzing driver performance, and tracked revenue growth across regions. These data-driven strategies helped enhance operations, increase profitability, and provide a more tailored customer experience.
